Hello from Taiwan! I think I will decide to document this 2-month Taiwan
internship that I will be embarking, for both educational and for my own purpose
of reflection. Later on, I may decide to publish these if I see fit. So this 
will be the first such post; I have been here for about a day, and immediately,
I think there are two things that really stick out to me: a) here in Taiwan, it
is very *hot* and *humid*! It is definitely not something that happens in
Dallas, where it can be hot but usually pretty dry. I've also noticed that
Taiwan has actually a lot of strict regulations, unlike back in Texas; I will
not go into much depth here. 

I have not yet started interning (I start next Monday), but I still do not know
what to expect particularly because of the language barrier there (even though I
sorta understand and speak Chinese, my Chinese compared to those native speakers
is pretty crap and bad... so I will probably have to communicate primarily in
English as I try to improve in the Chinese language.

I do not know what to expect for the next two months, whether it would be
enjoying or not, or even what the work experience will be like (it supposedly is
related to cybersecurity, so will be intereting?) Oh well, I will be signing off
until then.
