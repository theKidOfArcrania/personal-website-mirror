Hi! I am Henry Wang, aka `theKidOfArcrania`. I am a rising Junior
studying at The University of Texas At Dallas, majoring in Computer Science.

Over here you might find some blog posts that I put, mostly about my own opinion
on certain softwares and stuff. 

You will find that one of my biggest interest is in Assembly and Cyber 
Security. I love to do CTF competitions (especially the Pwn and Reverse
engineering categories)! 

Here is my current [resume][1], and feel free to contact me at my email:
